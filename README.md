# reaction-diffusion
**RBF-HFD code for reaction--diffusion on surfaces.**

This repository contains a simple Matlab script, *turing_script.m*, for simulating Turing patterns on surfaces using Hermite RBF interpolation to create a discretization of the Laplace--Beltrami operator.

The discretization is created by the function *rbf_hfd_laplace_beltrami.m*, and the additional files contain node sets and normals for two different surfaces.
